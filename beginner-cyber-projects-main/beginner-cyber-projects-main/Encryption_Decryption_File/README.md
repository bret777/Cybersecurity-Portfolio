# Encryption-Decryption Tool  

 📌 Overview  
This project is a file encryption and decryption tool that allows users to secure their sensitive files using a cryptographic algorithm. It provides an intuitive GUI for ease of use and supports encrypting and decrypting files effortlessly.  

 ⚙ Features  
✅ Encrypt files using strong encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)  
✅ Decrypt files back to their original form  
✅ Simple and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
✅ Secure key management to ensure protection  
✅ Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data  

 🚀 Usage  
1️⃣ Open the program and select a file to encrypt.  
2️⃣ Click the "Encrypt" button and save the encrypted file.  
3️⃣ To decrypt, select the encrypted file and click "Decrypt".  
4️⃣ The decrypted file will be saved in the same directory (or as specified).  

 📂 File Storage Locations  
🔹 Encrypted File: Saved in the selected location, typically with a `.enc` extension.  
🔹 Decrypted File: Stored with a "decrypted_" prefix or in the original format.  

 🛡 Security  
- Uses AES-256 encryption for robust security.  
- Never share your encryption key with anyone.
